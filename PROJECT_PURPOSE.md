# Project Purpose: x402 Donation Template (No Token Starter)

## What This Project Is

This is a **minimal starter template** for building donation pages using the x402 payment protocol. It's designed as a clean, bare-bones foundation that developers can fork and customize to create their own branded donation experiences.

## Core Purpose

- **Educational Guide**: Provides a working example of x402 integration without complex UI
- **Development Starter**: Gives developers a head start on donation page implementation
- **Customization Base**: No design assumptions - build your own UI on top
- **x402 Showcase**: Demonstrates how to use x402 for payment processing

## Key Features

- ✅ **No UI Design**: Pure functionality, no styling opinions
- ✅ **Complete Implementation**: All payment logic and API routes included
- ✅ **x402 Protocol**: Ready for Solana-based payments
- ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add custom UI, features, and branding
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Includes testing, build config, and deployment setup

## Target Audience

- **Developers** learning x402 payment integration
- **Projects** needing donation functionality
- **Teams** wanting a customizable starting point
- **Anyone** building crypto payment pages

## How It Works

1. **Fork/Download** this template
2. **Add Your UI** - Style the page.tsx with your design
3. **Configure** environment variables (wallet, project details)
4. **Deploy** to Vercel or your platform
5. **Accept Donations** via x402 protocol

## Why This Approach?

Instead of a full-featured template with complex UI, this provides:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Flexibility**: No design constraints
- **Learning**: Clear code structure for educational purposes
- **Foundation**: Solid base for any donation page needs

## Result

A donation page that looks exactly like you want it to, built on proven x402 payment infrastructure.</content>
